+Code the following app
+```
+Create an application for tracking sleep.
+Functional requirements:
+
+The user can enter the time they went to sleep and the time they woke up.
+
+The app automatically calculates the total sleep duration.
+
+The user can view their sleep history by day, week, or month.
+
+The app generates basic statistics: average sleep duration, shortest and longest sleep sessions.
+
+Include a simple bedtime reminder feature (non-medical, just user-defined time notifications).
+
+Store all data locally (e.g., using SQLite or a JSON file).
+
+Technical requirements 
+
+Programming language: Python 
+
+Interface: console app / web app / mobile app.
+
+Code should be clean, readable, and well-commented.
+
+Additional features:
+
+Allow exporting data (CSV or JSON).
+
+Optional: simple data visualization (e.g., Matplotlib, Chart.js).
+
+If you want, I can also:
+
+🔹 generate the full code
+🔹 create a prompt tailored to a specific technology
+🔹 design the whole structure of the app
+
+Just tell me the language and type of application you want!
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
