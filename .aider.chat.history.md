```
Create an application for tracking sleep.
Functional requirements:

The user can enter the time they went to sleep and the time they woke up.

The app automatically calculates the total sleep duration.

The user can view their sleep history by day, week, or month.

The app generates basic statistics: average sleep duration, shortest and longest sleep sessions.

Include a simple bedtime reminder feature (non-medical, just user-defined time notifications).

Store all data locally (e.g., using SQLite or a JSON file).

Technical requirements 

Programming language: Python 

Interface: console app / web app / mobile app.

Code should be clean, readable, and well-commented.

Additional features:

Allow exporting data (CSV or JSON).

Optional: simple data visualization (e.g., Matplotlib, Chart.js).

If you want, I can also:

🔹 generate the full code
🔹 create a prompt tailored to a specific technology
🔹 design the whole structure of the app

Just tell me the language and type of application you want!
```

Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
